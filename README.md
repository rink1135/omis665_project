# OMIS 665 RStudio Project
In this project, we are going to work with Chicago Crime Dataset from year 2012 - 2017.
We are going to analyze the dataset by first tidying our dataset and then apply manipulation functions, statistics, and visualization function to help answer our research questions to find patterns in crimes to prevent it from happening or reduce the rate of crimes happening.
